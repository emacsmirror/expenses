;; Add an expense entry conveniently using the interactive command
;; expenses-add-expense
;; A list of desired categories could be set using
;; setq expenses-category-list '(category1 category2 ..)
;; Set the desired destination for the expense files using
;; setq expenses-directory "desired/destination"
;; View the org file using
;; expenses-view-expense
;; Expenses for a given period like a date, month, months or year could be
;; calculated using appropriate interactive functions.  See the README on the github
